# MODELS OVERVIEW

# DiaryFood  - a food at a given datetime
#            - inherits nutritionABC
#            - source of data can be LOADED from ing/rec or just entered in by user
#              - effectively nutrition data crystallized when saving from ing/rec

# TODO: Base off other apps? "Exercise" "Biometrics"?
# DiaryExercise - record exercise session TODO
# DiaryStat - record weight or other biomentric data - resting heart rate, blood pressure etc TODO

# VIEWS OVERVIEW

# NOTE XXX must always filter all Diary views to just the logged in user's stuff!

# More TODO:
# Main List View - Combined Meal and Food and Exercise - just Food for now
#                - Meal should be explodable to individual foods
#                - Time scale should fan out to show values over 24hr etc - in progress
#                - Separate view for per-hour calculations?
# Detail Views for each model
#                - DiaryFood detail view includes forms to edit or update etc...
#                - "Clone to now"
#                - etc...
